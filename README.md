#Sub-Anagrams

This project represents a formal test of a hypothesis developed several years ago with some friends when we were discussing what the longest word in the English language is that contains no sub-anagrams. A sub-anagram is defined as any string that can be scrambled into a valid word.

The hypothesis tested in this program is that the longest such word is 'queue.' The result of the test is a tie between 'queue' and 'syzygy,' with syzygy being returned as the final answer as it comes later in the alphabet.

The dictionary used for this porject is taken from (SIL International)[http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/], and results may vary based on dictionary used.

This project does not represent optimized algorithmic methodologies as of now. The project is written entirely in one file and entirely in Ruby, and has additional methods for getting anagrams or sub-anagrams of any word given a particular dictionary.
